# Folders
DataStructure: for custom data structures used in tests
Lib: Contains classes and each class represents one page. Each class have methods that is used
on page
Tests: Tests to execute

#What is missing in this framework:
- Mechanism for plans
- logging mechanism (message and screenshots)
- mechanism for finding web element
- configurable information, so that one test is able to run with multiple values 
(eg. some json file to put keys and values, and we should have multiple files with same keys)
- class that should contains methods that are not application specific (something that
evety application can use)
- layer for methods that are common for multiple pages
